A simple game play of Mancala. You can play with a computer player.

## How to play
1. Make sure you have python3 installed.
   My version: `3.8.10`
1. Run the code.

   python main.py
   ```
1. Enjoy!

## What am I doing?
I aimed to practice and learn the following:
* Design patterns
* Clean code
* Machine Learning

But now, I hope this can be an ice-breaker for you and other developers ðŸ˜¸!

Please feel free to be critical on this project during your discussions, because that's how you get to know each other :)
